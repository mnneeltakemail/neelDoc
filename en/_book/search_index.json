features fiat gateways, smart contracts, mobile wallet, token issuance, a DEX (decentralized exchange), and more.\nMain Waves Features\n\nFully functional exchange that is as fast as a centralized one but does not suffer from the same security issues.\nSmart contracts include account and token controls, which provide functionality to implement features such as multi-signature wallets, atomic swaps and 2-factor authorization.\nIt provides the services of launching, distributing and trading crypto token (creation, issuance, transfer, exchange of assets and custom or fiat tokens).\nThe fiat-crypto problem is solved through Waves fiat gateways.\nWaves-NG protocol which greatly increases TPS capacity because miners no longer compete to verify transactions.\nLeased Proof-of-Stake(LPoS) algorithm to find a distributed consensus.\n\n If you're a new reader, please check our   DOCUMENTATION GUIDE  \n"},"overview/platform-components.html":{"url":"overview/platform-components.html","title":"Platform Components","keywords":"","body":"Waves Platform Components\n1. Waves Client\nThe Waves Client can be easily installed and used to perform most actions in the Waves Platform where users can issue, transfer and trade assets.\n2. Waves Wallet\n\nIt’s a fully-featured client that lets you access all features of the Waves platform.\n\nIt offers fiat integration, fast speeds, an intuitive interface, and custom tokens. It’s also constantly being updated.\n\nIt allows to store, track, transfer and manage your cryptocurrencies, the Tokens that you issue or the Tokens that you acquire.\n\nThe wallet has a built-in decentralized exchange platform that can be used to exchange assets, cryptocurrencies and fiat tokens.\n\n\n3. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX)\nDEX allows to place and execute orders for buying or selling cryptocurrency or Tokens for another cryptocurrency or exchanging them to other Tokens.\n4. Mobile apps\n\nWaves App is a mobile client for Waves Platform available for iOS and Android.\nThe wallet is connected to public Waves nodes in order to retrieve your transactions and send payments.\nGet started with Waves App for iOS and Android devices.\n\n5. Waves Gateways\nFiat Gateways such as USD/EUR will allow you to exchange any token issued on the Waves platform (or any other cryptocurrency like BTC/ETH/LTC/ZCash/BCH/Dash) for “real” money, which can be deposited in a bank. All transactions between cryptocurrency to fiat or fiat to cryptocurrency will be recorded on the Waves blockchain. This is like mixing the best of both worlds (i.e. centralized systems and decentralized systems).\n6.1 Fiat Gateways\nThe Waves US dollar and EUR gateways are available within the Waves Client — allowing anyone to deposit and withdraw USD, EUR and use the backed token within the Waves ecosystem. Waves users can deposit USD and EUR via the secure gateways, receiving in return a token that is 100% backed by USD or EUR reserves. This can be held, transferred and exchanged for other tokens quickly and at low cost, and withdrawn back through the gateway into the traditional financial system when required.\nthe USD and EUR gateways offer Waves users an easy way to move money into the blockchain ecosystem, enabling them to invest in tokens and ICOs with fiat. This was always one of the key propositions for the Waves platform: the ability to send and trade with fiat-backed tokens.\nNote. KYC/AML verification is needed to deposit and withdraw fiat money. However, KYC is not necessary for cryptocurrency transactions.\n6.2 Crypto Gateways\nAll currencies listed below are integrated in Waves through gateways. You can see gateways as a means to transfer a currency to and from the platform.\nCurrent List of crypto gateways:\n\nTransfers and Gateways\niOS: Transfers and gateways\nAndroid: Transfers and gateways\n\nCryptocurrency gateways can be used to move external currencies into and out of the Waves blockchain. Once the currencies have been confirmed as received by the gateway, the user’s wallet is credited with a Waves token that is 1:1 backed by the cryptocurrency held within the server. See more What is a payment gateway\nFees are minimal and the only delays are those required by blockchain confirmation times. We are planning to integrate more payment gateways in the future.\nFigure 1, Waves Crypto Gateways (current and upcoming).\n7. Nodes\nNodes are a critical part of our ecosystem. Run a Waves node, help process transactions, ask the community to lease their WAVES to you and get paid for securing the network.\nFeatures:\n\nA hosted server is adequate to run a node and no mining rigs or specialist hardware are required.\nIt allows to mine WAVES and MRTs (Miners Reward Tokens) and to act as a leasing pool to aggregate mining power from other users.\nReceiving rewards from the network by leasing your balance to a full node.\n\nNote. The current number of nodes is 168 in 23 different countries.\n7.1 Mining nodes (pools)\n\nYou don’t need any fancy hardware, just a simple hosted server and at least 1,000 WAVES.\nYou can run a public mining pool and have users lease their funds to you, thereby increasing your profits and sharing them with the community.\n\nYou can find the full list of Waves nodes for leasing with their corresponding address HERE.\n7.2 Official nodes with open API\n\nWavesGo is the foremost Waves node, with the biggest balance (16,214,530 WAVES) and a thriving community of supporters. The node distributes the WavesGo token to anyone who leases their funds to it.\nWavesnode.NET represents a developing community in Netherlands with a balance of 10,589,578 WAVES. The node accepts multiple tokens for fees and has a growing list of supporters — as well as offering unique Waves merchandise.\n\nNote. You can find a full nodes list at dev.pywaves.org and Here you can find a list of the top nodes by WAVES balance.\n7.3 Matcher nodes\nMatcher nodes are responsible for pairing orders and executing trades quickly, whilst they are still settled on the blockchain. You’ll need to send your orders to a Matcher. Orders are transferred to the matcher across an encrypted channel and will not be visible to others until it is executed. This largely eliminates the possibility of market manipulation. These nodes connect the seller to the buyer for a commission, and then fix the transaction in the Waves blockchain.\nIn principle, any full node can become a Matcher. Waves client connects to Matchers at nodes.wavesnodes.com by default.\nMatchers will receive fees for the service they provide, adding an additional revenue stream for Waves full nodes.\nNote. Waves node contains DEX Matcher which can be enabled while settings the Waves node configuration file in the section of Matcher Settings.\n8. MainNet / TestNet\n\nMainNet - this is the real deal, the live Waves blockchain where you in the worst case could lose money if you are not careful. You can access the mainnet via a full node. it's integrated with the GUI in the Waves client, allowing anyone to use it without any technical knowledge or blockchain downloads.\nTestNet - this is the test version of the Waves blockchain. here you'll find always the latest versions and newest features before they go live.\n\n"},"overview/waves-official-resources.html":{"url":"overview/waves-official-resources.html","title":"Neel Official Resources ","keywords":"","body":"Waves Official Resources\n\nOfficial website\nNew online client\nDesktop Client\nOnline Wallet\nMobile application for iOS\nMobile app for Android\nOpen Source code on GitHub\nTest Net\nMain Net\nSupport service\nWaves desk\nWavesGo\nOfficial Facebook group\nTwitter\nBlog\nCommunity Website\n\n"},"overview/security-notes.html":{"url":"overview/security-notes.html","title":"Security Notes","keywords":"","body":"Important Security Notes to Be Considered By End Users \n\nSEED and Password\nPersonal Account\nGeneral Notes\n\nSEED & Password \nBefore you create an account, you should know some important points about the Waves wallet system. In Waves wallet, there is no .dat file which keeps your private keys but a SEED which grants you access to them. The SEED is by default a string of 15 English words and basically your passphrase to your funds - if you lose your SEED, you lose access to your account.\nWe strongly encourage you to additionally back up the SEED on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place. The provided string of 15 English words is cryptographically extremely secure and with the current technology unbreakable (the chance someone can break a passphrase given by the client is 1:(2048^15)). Each and every SEED is only linked to one single Waves account. Every digit, character, symbol and space counts - if there is one space too much, a different account opens up. If there is a wrong symbol, a different account opens up. If there is a spelling mistake, a different account opens up.\nDuring the account creation, you will also be asked to generate a password for your address.\nThe password has two purposes:\n\nIt encrypts the SEED locally so the SEED is never sent to the network unprotected.\nYour account will be cached so you don't have to import the SEED from new every time you want to log in. The password secures that only you can log into your cached account.

Tokens can represent essentially any assets that are fungible and tradeable, from commodities to loyalty points to even other cryptocurrencies. Creating tokens is a much straightforward process as you do not need to modify the codes from a particular protocol or to create a blockchain from scratch. All you have to do to issue tokens is to follow a standard template on the blockchain such as on the Ethereum or on Waves platform which both allows you to create your own tokens.\nThe Main Deference Between Waves Tokens and Ethereum Tokens\nWaves Tokens\n\nWaves Platform empowers people with a non-coding background to develop tokens and even be able to launch their own ICOs without much hassle. The set-up is powered by WAVES tokens which enable users to transact over the platform.\n\nWaves enable you to create custom tokens, which means you can launch your own cryptocurrencies without any coding requirements.\n\nTokenization, you can make your own custom tokens or cryptocurrencies in one minute on the Waves platform and there are tools that make it incredibly easy to distribute new tokens and carry out various other activities. You will require at least 1 WAVES token to do so. You can decide what name to give the token, how many to be issued, and how many decimal fractions you want to keep. This is ideal for crowdfunding and ICOs.\n\nThe tokens you create can immediately be distributed and traded on Waves decentralized exchange, DEX, with no further work. All-in-all, it’s a far more streamlined and useful approach.\n\n\nEthereum Tokens\n\nEthereum Smart contracts are programmable computer codes that are self-executing and do not need any third-parties to operate.\nEthereum supports the ability to develop Smart Contracts using their platform and in the same directions Waves Platform has launched smart contracts on the Testnet so non-Turing complete contracts will cover a large proportion of use cases, including smart accounts and smart tokens on the Waves platform.\n\nTokens aren’t actually held in users’ Ethereum addresses. Rather, they’re registered to a smart contract and every time you move them, you’re really just updating the information that smart contract records. Waves tokens, however, are like WAVES itself  — meaning they are treated exactly the same and are held in your address, while the platform still supports token creation in the core and from the standard Waves wallet.\n\n\n"},"platform-features/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.html":{"url":"platform-features/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.html","title":"Decentralized Exchange (DEX)","keywords":"","body":"Decentralized Exchange (DEX) \n\nMotivation\nDecentralized Exchange\nWaves DEX\nMatcher Fee Calculation\nTradable Balance\nInstalling DEX\nInstalling your Own Matcher\n\nMotivation \nThe need to convert and exchange between crypto tokens is increasing with the enlargement of cryptocurrencies number. One of the main features of the blockchain environment is decentralization, but until recently only centralized exchanges existed, even for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Etherium. Many exchanges support the buy and sale of cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and cryptocurrency tokens. Examples of such centralized exchanges are Coinbase, BTC-e, ShapeShift and Mt.Gox.The centralization experience in this sphere is lamentable, the cause of a single point of failure - the exchange. In this case, all users funds should be kept in one place for participation in trade. The user's funds are stored directly in the exchange, and it is responsible not only for matching orders and keep the current order book in the correct state but also for depositors' funds. The Mt.Gox collapse is the brightest example of why it is not reliable, the resulting loss after compromised it was about 650,000 BTC. Someone can hack into exchange system and all users will lose everything, cause their private keys are kept all together, like in one of version BTC-e fund's theft. And these are not the only exchanges that have lost the funds of depositors in this way. The use of a decentralized approach in the entity of an exchange helps to avoid the involvement of many users assets into problems caused by the danger of front running by intruders into the work of exchange.\n1. Decentralized Exchange \nThe decentralized exchanges do not require users to trust them with their money: user's wallet is not controlled by a single entity. Orders are digitally signed directly by owners, as an authorization process. Users control their funds, but on-chain trading has the side effect of not real-time trading as at a centralized exchange.\nDecentralized exchanges have some advantages over centralized, but also drawbacks.\nIf all components of exchange are decentralized there is no automatic matching of buy and sell orders, this operation also should be done by users. For example for a specific order, which is validated and put in an order book, any other user can add a digitally signed counterorder and send the complete transaction with a pair of orders to the blockchain. Then the assets are transferred between the buyer and seller.\nAlso with such lack of automatic matching and fast cancellation, there is vulnerability to miner front-running. The miner of the next block will always have the option to execute canceled orders with themselves as the counterparty, potentially profiting from such an order.\nWhat if we decentralize not all components of exchange, but only the matcher part? This design eliminates two of the described problems above: the arbitrageur with already canceled orders, and miners front-running. Unlike centralized exchanges, the decentralized solution with centralized matcher won’t have the power to steal users’ deposits.\n2. Waves DEX \nWaves provides a decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows trading different assets back and forth between users, as a traditional exchange, with stronger security guarantees to end users due to its decentralized nature. An opportunity of creating some new assets, based on Waves, allows early trading of a crowdfunding stake, that provides liquidity for tokens. For this purpose, tokens should be sold in public locations, where buyers and sellers may post orders.\nThe real-time trading is achieved thanks to the only centralized design element of our DEX - the order book Matcher, which matches incoming orders and execute trades at high speed, typically within milliseconds. There is no need to wait for the next block to know whether a trade has been executed successfully, this provides speed at the level of centralized exchange and the security of the decentralized protocol.\nThe orders are linked in pairs by individual nodes, which work as Matcher. Before getting into Waves blockchain, exchange transactions are always checked by the nodes for matching the prices in orders so that the matcher cannot implement the \"wrong\" transactions. Then the Matcher creates Exchange Transaction, signs it with its signature and put it into blockchain for to fix changes in balances of users. The Matcher also can match orders partially, as at ordinal exchange. After the transaction is confirmed, Matcher's sign is validated by mining nodes and exchange transaction put into the blockchain, user account balances of assets are changed according to amount and order execution price. The important point is that the funds are transferred only after publishing in the blockchain. If the Matcher fails, the exchange will not take place, but the funds will not be lost, cause exchange does not own client's assets.\nA user initiates his willingness to purchase or sell assets by creating, signing and sending a Limit Order request to the Matcher node. The Limit Order here is the same as at all exchanges: an order for a buy (sell) of a fixed number of a token at a price equal or better than specified. When a new Order is submitted to the DEX all its fields are checked for adequacy and a signature is validated by sender's public key. Then, the Order is validated, based on internal Matcher state: Order with such id should not exist already and the sum of all Order amounts for a particular asset should be less or equal to the balance of that asset on sender's account. The scheme of work with the DEX is shown in the Figure 1:\nFigure 1\nUser can set an expiration time (maximum timestamp) to the order, and when the order expires it will be automatically canceled. One of the rules at DEX is that all orders older than 30 days will be canceled by default. An expiration time for each order is specified by the user at the time the order is signed. The expiration time is a long integer value that represents the absolute number of seconds since the UNIX epoch. When the order is unfilled and its expiration time is more than now UNIX timestamp, it can be canceled by the user. In this case, the order gets into blockchain as Cancelled order and nobody can fill it since that.\nThe full execution cycle for one order is following:\n\nIf for a submitted order there is no counter-order matched by price, then the order would be put in the corresponding order book.\nIf there is a counter-order that matches with the submitted order, then the order execution is performed. That means the counter-order is removed from order book and the matcher creates exchange transaction, signs it by matcher's private key and is sent to the Waves network for including in the blockchain.\nIf an amount of a submitted order is a big enough to execute a few orders, Matcher creates several transactions. Created transactions have amounts equal to matched counter-order amounts. Matched counter-orders are chosen in order of their acceptance time (First In, First Out).\n\nIn every time of order's life, it has a certain state, depending on which stage of its life cycle it is now. When an order is in an order book, but not filled yet - it has \"Accepted\" state, also it can be \"Filled\", \"Partially Filled\" or \"Canceled\". Orders, which are not fully filled, can be canceled, after that the order will be removed from matcher's order book.\n3. Matcher Fee Calculation \nThe fix full transaction fee now is equal to 0.003 waves for one order, whether buying or selling, regardless of the amount of the future deal. The exchange transaction contains two separate fields for Matcher's fee, which goes from buyer's order and seller's order. An order can be fully executed by some transaction, in this case, all matcher fee from it is included in that transaction.\nIf the order is partially executed by some deal-transaction, matcherFee is included in that transaction proportionally to the executed amount, i.e.\nexecutedAmount * orderMatcherFee / orderAmount.\nThe remaining matcher fee for this order will be included in other transactions until order's full execution.\n3.1 Example\nThere are 3 different orders (Figure 2): two buy orders and one sell. For each full order, a user has to pay exactly 0.003 waves of a fee, and this fee will be written off as the order is executed. In our example:\n\nthe Order1 is fully matched with a 70% part of Order3 by Transaction1 and matcher's fee for this transaction is equal to 0.003 + 0.0021 - 0.003 = 0.0021 waves since Matcher pay to miners transaction fee which is also equal to 0.003 Waves.\nThe 50% of Order2 matches with 30% part of Order3 by Transaction2 and matcher's fee for this transaction is equal to 0.0009 + 0.0015 - 0.003 = -0.0006 waves.\n\nThus, the fee that the matcher gets from users for these transactions is0.0021 - 0.0006  = 0.0015 waves. And the fee that the matcher pays to miners is0.006waves.\nFigure 2: example of matcher's fee work, TX1 - Transaction1, TX2 - Transaction2, Ord1 - Order1, Ord2 - Order2, Ord3 - Order3\n\nSummary: \n\n\n\nperiod\nmatcher's fee\nminer's fee\nleft for the matcher\n\n\n\n\nlast month\n681.42336675 waves\n569.721 waves\n16.39%\n\n\nall time\n3476.01418346 waves\n2824.771 waves\n18.74%\n\n\n\nTo sum up, for all time the matcher keeps only 18.74% of fees and everything else it pays to miners for placing transactions in blocks (data for 8.02.2018).\n4. Tradable balance\nTradable balance shows, how much you can spend in orders. It calculates by the formula:\ntradable_balance(asset) = balance_of_asset -\n  spendings_of_asset_in_transactions_in_utx_pool -\n  reserved_balance_for_asset\nbalance_of_asset\nThe current balance in asset:\n\nWAVES;\nassets.\n\nspendings of asset in transactions in utx pool\nThe sum of all spending by the asset of unconfirmed transactions.\nFor example, if you are transferring WAVES and sending a data transactionand these transactions haven't yet forged, spendings_of_WAVES_in_transactions_in_utx_pool will be amount_of_transferred_waves + transfer_fee + data_transaction_fee.\nNote: UTX pool of one node could not be the same as on other node.\nreserved balance for asset\nAlso known as open volume. The sum of all spending by the asset of all orders in pairs with this asset.\nFor example, you buy BTC by Bitcoin Cash (1) and sell Bitcoin Cash for WCT (2), and these orders are still active and haven't filled yet.Then spendings_of_Bitcoin_Cash_in_active_orders will be amount_of_spending_Bitcoin_Cash in (1) + amount_of_selling_Bitcoin_Cash in (2).\nNote, for WAVES order's fees are included in reserved balance.\nAs you know, all orders in DEX requires WAVES as the fee. Because of this, there is an exception for the rule we spoke above.If you buy WAVES by other asset, reserved balance in waves in this order will be: max(fee - amount_of_received_waves_in_this_order, 0).So, you can buy WAVES for BTC even if you have no WAVES.\n5. Installing DEX \n\nDownload the Waves client from our official website,\nwww.wavesplatform.com\n, or use the webwallet, available at\nclient.wavesplatform.com\nDeposit your bitcoins or any supported coins and tokens into the wallet and start trading using the Waves DEX.\n\n6. Installing your Own Matcher \n\nUsers can install their own matcher by installing the Waves software and enabling the matching functionality.\nThe Matcher earns fees from the services it provides, so you can substantially increase your mining revenues.\nWhen a user sends an order to Matcher he doesn't transfer ownership of his money to anyone, his money remains on his account until the order is matched with counter-order.\n\n Find more technical details about the Matcher   HERE.  \n"},"platform-features/assets-custom-tokens.html":{"url":"platform-features/assets-custom-tokens.html","title":"Tokens","keywords":"","body":"Assets\nAsset is a sort of a digital asset that has a certain consensus value.

Features\nNew versions of Waves software bring new features. Those new features should be activated by many nodes at the same time. Before now features were activated by timestamps. That put node owners in a tight time frame to update their nodes. Failure to update a node in time led to the unintentional participation to a fork. Features Activation Protocol gives the Waves community the ability to apply new features with a suitable pace. Or not apply some of them at all.\n1.1 Features identification\nEach new feature will be assigned a unique sequential number. List of new features with their IDs will be provided with each new release. Feature support by software\nNew features come with new versions of node’s software. Different versions could operate identically until activation of new features. After activation of a feature network will diverge in two parts: nodes that implement this feature and nodes that does not.\n1.2 Feature states on blockchain\nState of features is stored on the blockchain. The feature can be in one of three states. The initial state called Defined. Every feature, even non-existent, has it state initially. The next state - Approved. That means the feature received a required number of votes from miners. After a defined period (number of blocks) approved feature became Activated. From that moment (block) nodes that implement the feature start to operate in a new way.\n2. Voting\nVoting is performed by miners. If miner supports some feature and wants to vote \"yes\" it has to put its number (ID) in the list of supported features in the configuration file. From now on every block forged by this miner will contain the IDs of supported features. Every 10000 blocks (this number may differ on other blockchains) the node sums up the number of blocks with support for a feature. If a feature was supported in more than 80% of blocks during the last calculation period it became Approved. Otherwise, the voting continues and could take another voting period (10k blocks for Mainnet) or more.\nIf the node sees that a new feature was approved, but the node does not implement it, it will log the warning message about the upcoming activation of an unsupported feature.\nBefore an approved feature become Activated another 10000 blocks have to pass. This period intended for the update of non-mining nodes to a new version.\nIf a new feature was activated but the node was not updated to support it, the node will shutdown itself (default behavior) and log the error about activation of the unsupported feature.\nWarning\n On the Testnet approval and activation periods were set to 3000 blocks each.\n It will allow a faster activation of new features for testing purposes.\n3. Configuration file changes\nThe new configuration file section features was introduced. It contains two parameters:\n\nauto-shutdown-on-unsupported-feature could be yes or no. If this setting is turned on, the node will be shut down on activation of a feature that is not implemented by node’s codebase. By default, it set to yes.\n\nsupported contains the list of features IDs, that node owner is supporting. By default, the list is empty.\n\n\nBelow you can see an example of the new section.\n features {\n   auto-shutdown-on-unsupported-feature = yes\n   supported = []\n }\n\n4.

Example\nIn version 1.0.0 a new cool feature was introduced. It has ID 123.\nMining pool 'SuperMiners' with a total stake of 40% supports the feature. Administrator of 'SuperMiners' updates the node from version 0.9.9 to 1.0.0. And adds 123 to the list of supported features in the configuration file. 'SuperMiners' node starts to put ID 123 into each mined block since height 1228765. But no other miners supported the feature but some of them updated their nodes to version 1.0.0.\nAt block number 1230000 nodes calculated that only 50% of blocks contains support for feature 123. So, the status of feature stays unchanged, the voting was unsuccessful for the period and it continues.\nDuring the next 10000 blocks 'SuperMiners' convinced few smaller miners to support the feature. On block 1240000 it turns out that the feature is supported in 9102 of last 10000 blocks. That means 91%. So, the status of the feature changed to approved. At this moment nodes that run on version 0.9.9 and earlier warn their owners about the approval of an unsupported feature.\nAt block 1250000 the feature number 123 will be activated and nodes version 1.0.0 and above start use it. Nodes on earlier versions will stop working.\n"},"platform-features/neel-ng-protocol.html":{"url":"platform-features/neel-ng-protocol.html","title":"Neel-NG Protocol","keywords":"","body":"1. Scalability Limits and Challenges in Current Blockchain Systems \n1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation \nBlockchains protocols have some scalability limits and challenges that tradeoff between throughput and latency. The current blockchain technology is not fast enough and does not scale to include more transactions into the system so we have a performance challenge to be considered.\nThere is a united agreement between miners, consumers, and developers with several perspectives that we need to deploy scalability measures, and there has been an ongoing argument on how to improve Bitcoin’s scalability. Current proposals have focused on how big to make the blocks and how to handle the block size increases in the future.\nAll proposals suffer from a major scalability bottleneck:no matter what block size is chosen, the blockchain system can at best reach a proper transaction throughput, increasing from ~3 transactions per second to ~7 transactions per second. This is so far from the 30,000 transactions per second which necessary to compete with the existing systems such as VISA transactions. The same major limitations apply to litecoin, Ethereum, and all other currencies that share Bitcoin’s blockchain protocol.\nWaves-NG will address the scalability bottleneck by making the network to reach the highest throughput depends on the network conditions. It will not only enhance the transaction throughput, it will also reduce transaction latencies. So it will be possible to get an initial transaction confirmation in seconds rather than in minutes.\n\n\n\n\nLatency(Block Interval)\nBlock Size\nSpeed\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin\n10 minutes\n1 Mb\n3-7 Tx/Second\n\n\nEthereum\n10 minutes\n1 Mb\n5-20 Tx/Second\n\n\nWaves\n1 minute\n1 Mb.100 Tx/block\n1.6 Tx/Second\n\n\nWaves-NG\n1 minute between key blocks.3 seconds between micro blocks.\n1 Mb.65535Tx/KeyBlock.200 Tx/MicroBlock\n100 Tx/second\n\n\n\nTable1, Scalability comparison between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves and Waves-NG.\n\n1.2 Weaknesses of Current Proposals to Improve Scalability \nBlockchain Systems can process transactions and the maximum rate of these transactions is limited by the choice of two parameters: block size and block interval.\n\nThe block interval defines the average amount of time that passes between the creation of two blocks. By deciding to reduce the block interval to solve the latency limit, the system will have less security (increase forks probability) due to the reason of new miner for every second which will lead to instability where the blockchain is subject to reorganization and the system is in disagreement (Figure 1). If we reduce the time per block, then we will have a situation where a significant number of blocks are solved in less time than it takes to relay a solved block throughout the network. So there will be no way to know which block is the \"real\" one and which one is a \"fork\" because the transactions that appeared to have multiple confirmations suddenly have fewer confirmations (or possibly go back to being unconfirmed).\n\n\nFigure1, Increasing block frequency with Static blocksize will result to less security.\n\nThe throughput of a system is bounded by the maximum block size (given a fixed block interval), as the maximum number of included transactions is directly dependent on the block size.\nLarger blocks do however cause slower propagation speeds, which causes more discarded blocks (orphaning risk). An unlimited blocksize could, for example, result in a DoS attack on the system by creating a block that takes a long time to validate. If the choice is to Increase block size in order to improve throughput, there will be Network spikes with longer time to propagate in the network (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure2, Increasing block size with Static block frequency will lead to more discarded blocks and network spikes.\n1.3 Brief Summary of Bitcoin-NG \nIt is a next-generation blockchain protocol which is an alternative bitcoin scaling solution that does not involve increasing the size of blocks or decreasing the block time interval. This reduces the risk of forks amongst other advantages. Bitcoin-NG describes that the basic tradeoffs in Bitcoin can be reduced with an alternative blockchain protocol, offering a consensus delay and bandwidth limited only by the Network Plane. The protocol splits time into time periods(epoch). In each time period, a particular leader is responsible for serializing transactions (Figure 3).\nThe leaders take the rule of generating blocks:\n\nKey blocks for the election of a leader.\nMicro blocks for ledger records.\n\n\nFigure 3: Bitcoin-NG time periods structure with serializing transactions.\n2. Waves-NG Overlay \nWaves-NG is based on bitcoin next generation protocol that serializes transactions and offers important improvements in the transaction latency(lower latency) and bandwidth(higher throughput) in comparison to Bitcoin without sacrificing other properties.\nWaves approach this scalability matter by providing the miner with the ability to farm a block during the time of mining in continuous approach. This block continues increments called liquid block. This liquid block is unchangeable over time once the next block referencing is created and appended.\nThis approach increases effective bandwidth and speed of block creation, which is described as being “especially significant for businesses” using the Waves platform since it allows for conducting micro transactions - without any delays that are typical with traditional blockchain systems.\nFurthermore, it allows the platform to withstand high loads, such as distribution of tokens following crowdsales and airdrops of bonus tokens. The speed of processing trading transactions on Waves decentralized exchange (DEX) is increased as well.\n2.1 Waves-NG operations \nThe main and core idea of Waves-NG is to split the Liquid block into two types, Key blocks and Micro blocks. The process of creating liquid block works as follows:\n\nThe miner node gets the permission to create a block.\nThe miner node creates and sends the key block (which does not contain transactions).\nThe miner node creates and sends the micro blocks (which contain transactions just as in normal block with a reference to previous micro block or key block) with mining time interval of three seconds.\nMiners will mine those micro blocks and propagate them directly to the network until the next new key block appears with a referencing to the liquid block.\n\nAll of the transactions are part of the same block and are contributed all together. In between blocks, the traditional Bitcoin system appears idle to an onlooker, as miners are working to discover the next block, but without apparent progress on the consensus front.\nIn contradiction, in Waves-NG, the key-blocks can be small because they need to contain only the coinbase transaction, which defines the public key that the miner will be using to sign microblocks.Because a key-block requires proof of stake, miners can not just produce one and expropriate the leadership at will.\nFollowing the key-block, the lead miner can quickly issue microblocks, simply by signing them with the private key corresponding to the public key named in the key-block’s coinbase (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Key-blocks and Micro-blocks signing process.\n2.1.1 Leader blocks \nIt's also called \"Key Blocks\", these blocks are generated with proof of stake but does not contain transactions.\nThey serve as a leader election mechanism and contain a public key that identifies the chosen leader.\nEach block has a header that contains, among other fields, the unique reference of its predecessor which is a cryptographic hash of the predecessor header (either a key block or a microblock).\nAs in Bitcoin, for a key block to be valid, the cryptographic hash of its header must be smaller than the target value. Unlike Bitcoin, a key block contains a public key that will be used in subsequent microblocks.\n2.1.2 Micro blocks \nOnce a node generates a key block it becomes the leader. As a leader, the node is allowed to generate microblocks at a set rate smaller than a predefined maximum.\nThese micro blocks will contain the ledger entries with no requirement for any Proof of Stake and they're generated by the elected leader in every block-generation cycle.\nThis block-generation cycle is initiated by a leader block.\nThe only requirement is to sign the micro blocks with the elected leader's private key.\nThe micro blocks can be generated at a very high speed by the elected leader(miner), thus resulting in increased performance and transaction speed.\nFor a microblock to be valid, all its entries must be valid according to the specification of the state machine, and the signature has to be valid. Figure 5 illustrates the structure.Note that microblocks do not affect the weight of the chain, as they do not contain proof of stake.\nWhen all micro blocks have been validated, they will be merged with their key block into one block.\n2.2 Waves-NG reward mechanisms \nRemuneration is comprised of two parts. First, each key block entitles its generator a set amount. Second, each ledger entry carries a fee.\nThis fee is split by the leader that places this entry in a microblock and the subsequent leader that generates the next key block.\nIn order to motivate participants to follow the protocol, Waves-NG uses the following mechanisms:\nEach transaction pays a fee to the system, but unlike Bitcoin, this fee is distributed, with 40% to the leader, and 60% to the subsequent leader.\nFinally, if a leader forks the chain by generating two microblocks with the same parent, it is punished by revoking the subsidy revenue; whoever detects the fraud wins a nominal fee, (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: chain structure of the Waves-NG protocol. Microblocks (circles) are signed with the private key matching with the public key in the last key block (squares). The fee is distributed 40% to the leader and 60% to the next one.\nIn practice, the remuneration is implemented by having each key block contain a single coinbase transaction that mints new coins and deposits the funds to the current and previous leaders.\nAs in Bitcoin, this transaction can only be spent after a maturity period of 100 key blocks, to avoid non-mergeable transactions following a fork.\n Find more technical details about Waves-NG   In This Section.  \n"},"getting-started/as-a-developer.html":{"url":"getting-started/as-a-developer.html","title":"As a Developer","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started as a Developer\n\nOverview\nClient Libraries\nNode REST API\nSmart Contracts\nDEX API\nKeeper API\n\nOverview\nThis page introduces you to the things you'll need to get started on your journey.\nThis will give you all the information you need as a developer to get started in an easy to read and concise format.\nClient Libraries\nWaves Client is supported by many libraries, please Get to know our client libraries_ _and use them depending on which language you're familiar with:\n\nPython: PyWaves\nJava: WavesJ\nC#: WavesCS\nTypeScript/JavaScript, Waves Signature Adapter and Waves Transactions\nC: WavesC\nCommunity Libraries\n\nNode REST API\nThe Waves Node API provides RESTful platform for implementing blockchain functionality in apps using Waves blockchain.\nUse the API to integrate a variety of functionalities including orders, transaction history, and balances.\nSmart Contracts\nUsually as a developer, you will need two things: theoretical understanding and tools to make your coding life easier, in our guide we will provide you with both:\nTheoretical Understanding \nYou will need to know:\n\nHow Waves smart contract works (You can go through our smart contract guide to get more information about it) and you can read about our smart accounts and smart assets.\n\nWhich programming language to use (we're using our own language which called RIDE, Get to know RIDE).\n\n\nlet's suppose now that you understand the main idea of our smart contracts and you want to go through all functions and to understand how they work, please find here our functions and standard library.\nTools to help you with RIDE\nIn Waves, we always think about the best way to help external developers and because of that we will provide you with some useful tools:\n\nWaves IDE , Try out the new non-turing complete Waves smart contract language Ride by using our IDE.\nWaves console and its commands, Waves IDE has a Waves console feature which supports different commands.\nGet to our Tutorials, We believe that the best way to learn is by practical examples.\n\nDEX API\nThe reason behind decentralized exchange is to perform secure exchange of assets issued on Waves platform.\nThe real-time trading is achieved thanks to the only centralized design element of our DEX - the order book Matcher, which matches incoming orders and execute trades at high speed, typically within milliseconds.

By Running a Waves node, you help in processing transactions and you will increase your profit for securing the network if users start leasing their funds to your node (The more WAVES you lease to a node, the more rewards you will receive, you can lease any sum from 0.002 WAVES).\nThe WAVES you own (or that have been leased to you) reflect your mining power, the more you own, the higher your chances of processing the next block and receiving the transaction fees as a reward. The final amount will also depend on overall network activity and the level of fees generated.\nThe Waves full node serves two critical roles:\n\nTo relay blocks and transactions to miners\nTo answer queries for end users about the state of the blockchain.\n\nRunning a Node\nThere're different options when you want to deal with Waves full node and you will need to check the node configuration before following any option. The balance of the node can be empty until there are enough people wishing to lease to it by reaching together the generating balance of 1000 WAVES(the minimum balance) and create together a pool.\nInstalling a node\n\nThe easiest way to run a Waves Node is by using the new Waves Docker container. It requires just one command to enable everything or to change the settings of the node.\nThe another way is to download the latest version of waves.jar and the required .conf configuration file (for mainnet or testnet) to any folder, for example ~/waves. You can follow these steps of installing a node depending on your operating system.\n\n Please check   The Activation Process of New features.  \nGetting actual blockchain\nAfter installing a node, you will have different ways to get the blockchain. follow the getting blockchain guide.\nAlready a node owner\nIf you're already a node owner, you will need to check the new updates and then go for one of these two options:\nUpgrade your node\nBasically, the node should be upgraded by following the upgrading instructions.\nDealing with Forks\nYou can check the blockchain height or the last 100 signatures of blocks to understand if your node is on fork or not.\nYour node can be in one of two possibilities: your node on fork with height less than 2000 blocks or more than 2000 blocks.In case that your node is on fork with a height less than 2000 blocks, here you can implement rollback through rollback instructions.

Validation entails ensuring that the format of the block is correct, all hashes in the new block were computed correctly, the new block contains the hash of the previous block, and each transaction in the block is valid and signed by the appropriate parties. Full nodes may also act as mining nodes (i.e., generating new blocks), The mining node checks that each transaction is self-valid since the other nodes would reject the block if it included invalid transactions.\nAny node may propose new transactions, and these proposed transactions are propagated between nodes until they are eventually added to a block.\nNote. You can find a full nodes list at dev.pywaves.org and Here you can find a list of the top nodes by WAVES balance.\n"},"neel-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.html":{"url":"neel-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.html","title":"How To Install a Node","keywords":"","body":"Structure\n\nHow to Install a node\nSystem Requirements\nActivation Process of New Features\n\nHow to Install a Node\nTo run the Waves node have to go through 2 steps:\n\nInstall the JRE 1.8 (64-bit version).\nDownload Waves package and configure the application.\n\nP.S. you can check Waves Releases Here.\nPrior to the launch of your nodes, make sure you read the configuration specification!

Synchronization of the state during a regular operation of the node.\nBuild from scratch, here you will need to run the node, then it will receive all the needed information from the other nodes.\nAfter launch, the node begins to receive blocks from the network, verify them and validate the signature.  By affecting these components, you can reduce the time to reach the current state.  So, the following factors affect network sharing:\n\nInternet channel width\nnetwork latency\nnumber of connected peers\nIf the first two parameters depend only on your Internet provider, the third one can be affected by the max-outbound-connections parameter.  We believe that the default value of 30 is enough.  In general, network sharing has little impact on the total time (unless of course, you have a dial-up connection).  Much more expensive are a block verification time and a signature verification, which we will discuss in the next paragraph.\n\n2. Importing state from a previously prepared file\nImport state, here the user needs to stop the node before starting the process of exporting the blocks.\nIn this case, we exclude network sharing costs (we don’t count the time to download the file itself). In addition, the import will not allow our node to \"get on the fork\"The speed of block verification and signature verification affects the time of reaching the current state by the import method. These operations are performed on the CPU. The verification of the blocks goes in one stream, therefore, a gain in time will be given by a high-frequency CPU rather than a multicore one. The signature verification operation is multi-threaded, but against the background of block verification, it has an insignificant effect.In other words, there is practically no difference when using 8 or 16 cores CPUs operating at the same frequency.\nThe remaining blocks will be synchronized during normal operation.\nWhen synchronizing the state, an active writing to disk exceeds the IOPS values that the HDD gives. In particular, there may be delays when the operating system doesn't have enough physical memory. We recommend keeping at least 30% of the total memory for the needs of the operating system (cache/buffers).Therefore, we choose SSD.\n3. Copy the finished node database\nDownloading state, approximately the size of the State is around 23 GB (in November 2018).\nIn this case, the longest operation is to download the archive. Then it is enough to unpack the archive files to the /var/lib/waves/data directory and run the node.  The remaining blocks will be synchronized during normal operation.\nStatistics (0-1220000)\nBlock verification is not a linear operation, “heavy” blocks are verified longer. The ”heaviness\" of a block is determined by the number and type of transactions it contains.  So the first blocks (for example, the first 200.000) are empty and verified much faster than the same number of blocks after the million.

HOCON stands for Human-Optimized Config Object Notation. The complete description of HOCON could be found in the Official HOCON documentation. The advantages of HOCON are simple syntax and ability to use comments.\nDefault Configs and Overrides\nDefault Configuration Embedded into JAR\nComplete default Waves Node configuration file which is embedded into jar-file can be found here: https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.conf\nMainNet and TestNet config in DEB-packages\nIf you use DEB-packages to install a node, they also contain configuration files which override some parameters specific to the network:\n\nhttps://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/master/waves-mainnet.conf\nhttps://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/master/waves-testnet.conf\n\nOverriding parameters when running JAR-file\nIf you run JAR file it's recommended to override default parameters by passing a path to config file as the command line parameter then starting Waves Node application.\njava -jar waves-all-0.13.3.jar waves.conf\nTypically this file should contain you node's unique characteristics (ip, name, keys, etc...) and network-specific parameters similar to waves-mainnet or waves-testnet configs from previous sections (files shipped with DEB packages).\nConfiguration Sections\nWaves configuration section\nRoot configuration section waves holds essential application parameters and other configuration subsections.\nUsing parameter directory it is possible to set a path to the base application directory. Starting from version 0.6.0 it is possible to use environment variables to set configuration parameters. For example, by default, the base directory constructed relative to the user’s HOME environment variable. Please, do not enclose environment variables references in quotes, in this case, they will be handled as strings and won’t be resolved.\nNote: If you want to change waves directory in Ubuntu packages you should change it using -J-Dwaves.directory=path in /etc/waves/application.ini and /lib/systemd/system/waves.service. You can override any JVM start parameter in waves.service, it has priority.\nNote: For Windows users. Often on Windows, the HOME environment variable is not set. Please, replace ${HOME} with ${HOMEPATH} or ${APPDATA} in your additional configuration file. Also, you should remember that Windows' environment variables names are case sensitive.\nParameter data-directory sets the location of LevelDB database folder. In this database stored blockchain data and state.\nUsing parameter leveldb-cache-size you can set the size of theinternal cache of LevelDB database.\nNote: The number of bytes should be given to set the cache size parameter. But you can use size units: K - for kilobyteM - for megabytesG - for gigabytes\nNetwork settings \nIn network section P2P network related settings could be set.\nUse file parameter to set the location of peers database. In this database node stores lists of known and blacklisted peers. By default, the path is resolved with regard to base directory from waves section.\nUsing declared-address parameter you can set the external IP address and port number of the node. It’s necessary to work behind NAT in most cloud hosting, where the machine does not interface directly with the external address. If you do not specify it, then your node connects to the P2P network, but it won’t listen to incoming connections so other nodes will not be able to connect. Other nodes are connected to your node using these data. The format of this parameter is \"[ip-address]:[port]\".\nUsing parameter bind-address you can set the IP address of local network interface on which Waves Node will accept incoming connections. By default, node binds to 0.0.0.0 that means that it will listen on all available network adapters.\nUse port parameter to set the network port number to which other Waves nodes will connect. Check that the port is reachable from outside otherwise, your node will connect to P2P network only using outgoing connections. If this the port is taken by other application, your node won’t start.\nParameter node-name could be used to set the name of your node visible to other participants of the P2P network. The name transmitted during initial handshake. In the default configuration, this parameter is commented out, which leads to random name generation.\nParameter nonce is sent during a handshake. By default, it’s not set and nonce will be generated randomly. This value is used to distinguish nodes connected from one IP address.\nThe known-peers parameter stores the list of bootstrap nodes to which your node will establish outgoing connections while initializing. By default it set to Testnet nodes.\nThe peers-data-residence-time parameter could be used to set the period of time during which the node stores information about external peer since last communication session with it.\nNote: All time span parameters are set in milliseconds. But duration units can be used to shorten the value. Supported units are: s - second, secondsm - muinute, minutesh - hour, hoursd - day, days For usage examples see the default configuration file above.\nParameter black-list-residence-time could be used to set the period of time for which information about external peer stays in the blacklist.\nUse max-inbound-connections parameter to set the maximum number of simultaneous inbound connections handled by the node.\nUse max-outbound-connections parameter to limit the number of outgoing network connections.\nUsing max-single-host-connections parameter you can specify the allowed number of network connections made from single IP address.\nParameter connection-timeout could be used to change the network communication timeout.\nParameter outbound-buffer-sizeis used to set the network buffer size. Better leave the default value, incorrect buffer size could lead to node malfunction.\nParameter max-unverified-peers could be used to change the maximum size of the buffer to store information about peers during handshake process.\nUse enable-peers-exchange parameter to enable requesting and sending the information about peers.\nParameter enable-blacklisting allows to enable or disable blacklisting of peers.\nUse peers-broadcast-interval parameter to set the period of time between broadcasts of known peers list to other nodes.\nUsing handshake-timeout parameter it is possible to set time period to wait for reply during handshake. In case of no reply the peer will be blacklisted.\nIn upnp section you can set the UPnP settings. Actually, those settings are useful only if you ran your Waves node on the home network where the node could ask your router to establish a tunnel. By default, this functionality is disabled. Useenableparameter ofupnpto enable this functionality.\nIn traffic-logger section you can enable or disable logging of some of incoming or outgoing network messages. Network messages are logged at TRACE level.\nWallet settings \nIn wallet section you can configure wallet built in Waves node.\nUse file parameter to set the path to the wallet file. By default, the path to the file is calculated relative to the base application directory.\nParameter password could be used to set the password string to protect the wallet file.\nUsing seed parameter you could recreate an existing wallet on a new node. Provide the BASE58 string of your seed here. If you don’t have any existing wallet comment out this parameter and start the node. During the first run, the application will create a new wallet with a random seed for you. In this case, the seed will be displayed in the application log. If you miss it or if you don’t want to check the log files, it will also be available in REST API using the wallet/seed method.\nWarning: The wallet is a critical part of your node. Better to create its file in a safe and protected location. Don’t forget to backup your wallet’s file. It’s recommended to remove the seed from the configuration file immediately after the start of the node. If an attacker gains access to this seed string, he has access to all your funds on all your addresses!\nUpdate wallet's settings\nIf you want to run the node with another wallet, you have to: \n\ndelete/cope to another location your wallet.dat file for making directory /wallet empty\nupdate seed at config file \n\nAfter that node will use another wallet settings.\nBlockchain settings \nHere you can select the blockchain type or create your own blockchain.\nUse parameter max-transactions-per-block-diff to set the number of transactions stored in memory before storing on disk. Reducing the number could increase the number of disk operations.\nYou can change the number of blocks stored in memory using parameter min-blocks-in-memory.\nUsing type parameter you can select the blockchain type. Three choices are available: TESTNET, MAINNET and CUSTOM. For TESTNET or MAINNET types, parameters of blockchain are built in the application so you don’t have to configure them. But if you select CUSTOM blockchain type you have to provide the custom configuration section (which is commented out in the example).\nConfiguring custom blockchain \nUse parameter address-scheme-character in section custom to set the address feature character. This character used while building an address and also passed over a network during a handshake. The latter allow nodes not connect to the nodes with other blockchains.\nfunctionality section allows you to set the timestamps of activation of different blockchain validations. It’s better to set all functionality settings to 0 to have a blockchain with all validations active.\nIn genesis section it is possible to describe the first (genesis) block of your custom blockchain.\nUse block-timestamp parameter to set the date of creation of genesis block. Using parameter timestamp it is possible to set time of creation for genesis transactions.\nUsing signature parameter you can set the signature of genesis block.\nIn initial-balance parameter it’s possible to set the total amount of coins. This value should be given in the smallest units of cryptocurrency.\nUsing initial-base-target parameter it’s possible adjust the speed of block generation in the very begging of your custom blockchain.\nUsing average-block-delay parameter you can set the speed of block generation in your blockchain. This is a target period of time between blocks. In reality delays between blocks could vary.\nIn transactions parameter you should provide the list of first transactions. Each transaction is described by recipient’s address (as BASE58 string) and amount. You have to distribute all initial balance to one or more addresses in genesis block. If you failed to do so, the genesis block will be considered as incorrect and the application won’t start.\nCheckpoints settings \nIn this section, you can configure the public key for checkpoints verification sent over the P2P network. Provide the BASE58 representation of public key using public-key parameter. It’s useful to change this parameter only in CUSTOM blockchains.\nMatcher settings \nConfiguration section matcher could be used to configure DEX matcher.\nUse enable parameter to enable DEX matcher. By default, it’s disabled.\nIn account parameter you could provide the address of the matcher. This address is used to receive orders and pay or collect fees.\nUsing bind-address it’s possible to set the IP address of local network interface to bind matcher’s REST API.\nport parameter is used to set the port number on which the matcher’s REST API will accept incoming connections.\nUsing min-order-fee parameter it’s possible to set the minimum required fee to process orders. For now, matcher accepts fee only in WAVES. The fee should be given in minimal units (WAVELETS).\nUse order-match-tx-fee parameter to set the transaction fee of order match transactions created by the matcher.\nParameter matcher-direcotory could be used to set the location of matcher’s files.\nIn data-directory, journal-directory and snapshots-directory parameters, you can set the location of matcher’s data. Matcher has its own LevelDB database.\nParameter leveldb-cache-size allows to set the size of cache for Matcher’s LevelDB database. By default it’s the same as for the node.\nUse snapshots-interval parameter to change the period of time between snapshots of matcher’s state.\nUse order-cleanup-interval parameter to adjust how often clean up of expired orders occurs.\nUsing max-open-ordersparameter you can limit the number of unmatched orders stored in the matcher.\nUsing parameters price-assets and predefined-pairs it is possible to define rules of assets pairs creation for the matcher. Inside the matcher a trading pair consists of an \"amount\" asset and a \"price\" asset. The \"amount\" asset is used to specify the amount in order. The \"price\" asset is used to specify the price in order.\nParameter price-assets is the list of assets IDs that will be used as price asset (second one) in a pair with any unknown asset. If both assets in the pair are \"price\" assets you have to use parameter predefined-pairs to define the correct order of assets in the pair.\nIn case of no definition given, assets will be sorted by their IDs and the first will be selected as \"price\" asset and the second will be chosen as \"amount\" asset.\nTo specify Waves as a side of a pair use special asset ID \"WAVES\".\nBelow you can find an example of setting assets pairs.\nprice-assets = [\n     \"WAVES\",\n     \"Fmg13HEHJHuZYbtJq8Da8wifJENq8uBxDuWoP9pVe2Qe\",\n     \"HyFJ3rrq5m7FxdkWtQXkZrDat1F7LjVVGfpSkUuEXQHj\",\n     \"2xnE3EdpqXtFgCP156qt1AbyjpqdZ5jGjWo3CwTawcux\",\n     \"6pmDivReTLikwYqQtJTv6dTcE59knriaodB3AK8T9cF8\"\n   ]\npredefined-pairs = [\n     {amountAsset = \"WAVES\", priceAsset = \"Fmg13HEHJHuZYbtJq8Da8wifJENq8uBxDuWoP9pVe2Qe\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"WAVES\", priceAsset = \"HyFJ3rrq5m7FxdkWtQXkZrDat1F7LjVVGfpSkUuEXQHj\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"WAVES\", priceAsset = \"2xnE3EdpqXtFgCP156qt1AbyjpqdZ5jGjWo3CwTawcux\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"WAVES\", priceAsset = \"6pmDivReTLikwYqQtJTv6dTcE59knriaodB3AK8T9cF8\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"Fmg13HEHJHuZYbtJq8Da8wifJENq8uBxDuWoP9pVe2Qe\", priceAsset = \"2aSqCbvCTgvCpwkGsk4mea4tCLG4Zgp69aQDhHNvRUZv\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"Fmg13HEHJHuZYbtJq8Da8wifJENq8uBxDuWoP9pVe2Qe\", priceAsset = \"8zEZuJcKPQmFuYgVe5ZMpxgiPLu5zBhjA6xgdGomQDaP\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"Fmg13HEHJHuZYbtJq8Da8wifJENq8uBxDuWoP9pVe2Qe\", priceAsset = \"D2MNuUyA38pSKoV7F7vpS15Uhw9nw5qfbrGUfCLRNuRo\"},\n     {amountAsset = \"2xnE3EdpqXtFgCP156qt1AbyjpqdZ5jGjWo3CwTawcux\", priceAsset = \"HyFJ3rrq5m7FxdkWtQXkZrDat1F7LjVVGfpSkUuEXQHj\"}\n   ]\n\nParameter max-timestamp-diff is used to set the maximum allowed time difference between order and local matcher’s time.\nParameters blacklisted-assets and blacklisted-names could be used to blacklist assets from DEX.\nIt is possible deny operations on DEX for some addresses using parameter blacklisted-addresses.\nMiner settings \nIn section miner it is possible to configure parameters of the new blocks generator.\nUse enable parameter to enable or disable block generation on the node. By default, it’s enabled, but if you disable it your node won’t try to generate new blocks (won’t mine).\nUse quorum parameter to set the minimum required number of connected peers to enable and start mining of new blocks. It defaults to 1, so your node will start mining as soon as it connects to the first peer in the P2P network. Setting this parameter to 0 will enable off-line generation.\nUsing interval-after-last-block-then-generation-is-allowed parameter you tune your node’s blocks download and generation behavior. By default, it set to 1 day, which means that your node won’t start block generation until it has the last block in the local blockchain not older than 1 day. So, using this parameter you order you node to actualize the blockchain before starting to generate new blocks. Actually, it works only after long node shutdowns.\nREST API settings \nIn section rest-api you can set the node’s REST API parameters.\nUse enable parameter to activate or deactivate REST API.\nParameter bind-address could be used to select network interface on which REST API will accept incoming connections.\nParameter port could be used to change the port number on which REST API will await connections.\nWarning: Attention! For better security, do not change bind-address from 127.0.0.1 if you do not know what you’re doing! For external access, you should use instead Nginx’s proxy_pass module or SSH port-forwarding.\nUse api-key-hash parameter to set the hash of your API key. The API key is used to protect calls of critical API methods. Remember, that in this parameter you should provide the hash of API key, but during REST calls you should provide API key itself. You can use API method /utils/hash/secure to produce the hash of your API key.\nWarning: API key is transmitted in the HTTP header as unprotected plain text! An attacker could intercept it in network transit and use it to transfer your money to any address! So you have to protect the transmission using HTTPS or use SSH port forwarding.\nParameter cors could be used to enable or disable CORS support in REST API. CORS allows to safely resolve queries to other domains outside the one running the node. It’s necessary for Swagger and Lite client. You can read about it here.\nSynchronization settings \nIn synchronisation section it is possible to tune different aspects of node synchronization process.\nUse max-rollback parameter to change the length of blockchain that can be discarded in case of fork detection. In your node find yourself on a fork with a lower score, it will try to switch to another fork, to do so the node will rollback few blocks. If the detected fork is longer than the given number, node prefers not to switch to another fork even if its score is bigger.\nParameter max-chain-length is used to set the size of the buffer that stores blocks of detected fork. This size should be bigger than maximum fork length.\nParameter synchronization-timeout could be used to set the timeout on block download operation.\nUse parameter score-broadcast-interval to set the interval between score broadcasts to the P2P network.\nUse parameter score-ttl to set the time-to-live interval of broadcasted score packets.\nParameter remote-score-debounce allows to set the time to wait before receiving the next score update from a peer.\nIn history-replier subsection you can configure the number of last blocks and micro-blocks cached in memory.\nIn micro-block-synchronizer subsection you could tune various parameters of Waves-NG protocol.\nUTX pool settings \nIn this section, you can change the size of unconfirmed transactions pool (max-size parameter) and maximum age of transactions allowed to UTX (max-transaction-age).\n"},"neel-full-node/logging-configuration.html":{"url":"neel-full-node/logging-configuration.html","title":"Logging Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Logging Configuration\nAbout the used framework\nFor log writing, we use one of the logging frameworks logback.

Empty asset (\nWAVES\n) is always first in the pair. Thus:\n\nAssetPair(spendAssetId, receiveAssetId) == AssetPair(receiveAssetId, spendAssetId) = (Asset1, Asset2)\n\nFor each AssetPair, there is exactly one OrderBook. AsetPair exists independently of which asset is 'spend' and which is 'received'. Thus for two different assets one AssetPair is created and corresponding Order Book is used for trading that AssetPair.\nAfter AssetPair is determined, Order can be considered of 'BUY' or 'SELL' type with the following rule:\nval (Asset1, Asset2) = AssetPair(spendAssetId, receiveAssetId)\nif (receiveAssetId == Asset1) OrderType.BUY\nelse if (spendAssetId == Asset1) OrderType.SELL\n\nOrder validation rules\nWhen a new Order is submitted to the Matcher all its fields are validated:\n\namount should be > 0 and \nprice should be > 0 and \nmatcherFee be > 0 and \nmaxTimestamp should be > now and \nsignature should be valid with regards to sender's public key\n\n*MaxAmount = 10^18\nAdditionally, the Order is validated based on internalMatcherstate:\n\nOrder with such id should not exist already\nSum of all open Order amounts for a particular spendAssetId should be spendAssetId on sender's account.\n\nMatching algorithm\nPrice calculation\nA new submitted Order is matched against some Order in OrderBook if there is such order that its price is better or equal to the submitted one.\n\nFor 'BUY' order better means there is a 'SELL' order with price \nFor 'SELL' order better means there is a 'BUY' order with price >= submitted\n\nExecution price of ExchangeTransaction is always determined by the price of an order that was accepted earlier, i.e. an order that is already in OrderBook.\nFull execution\n\nIf for a submitted order there is no counter-order matched by price (which price equal or better) that order would be put in the corresponding OrderBook and remains open until executed or until maxTimestamp is reached.\nIf there is a counter-order that matches with a submitted order then _order execution _is performed. That means the counter-order is removed from OrderBook and ExchangeTransaction is created and signed by the Matcher's private key and is sent to the Waves network to be included in the blockchain.\nIf there are multiple orders, that are matched with a new order, the earliest on based on acceptance time gets chosen.\n\nPartial execution\n\nIf an amount of a submitted order is a big enough to execute a few orders, Matcher creates several ExchangeTransaction. Created transactions have amounts equal to matched counter-order amounts. Matched counter-orders are chosen in order of their acceptance time (FIFO).\nIf after the execution of all counter-orders at a particular price there is still remaining amount from the submitted order, the next price level of OrderBook, which satisfy the incoming price, is used to execute orders. For all matched counter-orders corresponding ExchangeTransaction are created similarly to the previous step.\nIf after all matches found on the previous steps there is still remaining amount from the submitted order and there are no other open orders matched by the price, a new Order is put on OrderBook with remaining amount out of initialOrder.\nIf the first matched order in OrderBook has an amount greater than the submitted one, ExchangeTransaction will be created with amount equals to the incoming order. Partially executed counter-order will be substituted with remaining amount in OrderBook.\n\nMatcher fee calculation\n\nExchangeTransaction contains two separate fields for Matcher's fee, which goes from _BUY _and _SELL _orders.\nIf Order is fully executed by some transaction, all matcherFee from it is included in that transaction.\nIf Order is partially executed by some transaction, matcherFee, proportionally to the executed amount, is included in that transaction, i.e. executedAmount * orderMatcherFee / orderAmount\nIf partially executed Order is fully executed by some transaction, all remaining matcherFee (after previous matches) is included in that transaction.\n\nExchangeTransaction fields\nNew transaction type for blockchain is created for assets exchange.

Bot","keywords":"","body":"Create your first crypto trading bot\nIntroduction\nWaves platform is designed and built from the ground up for speed and scale. At the same time Waves is one of the most developer-friendly ecosystems. Waves blockchain exposes its functionality through a powerful REST API, that can be used with any programming language.\nThis text guides you through the basics of Waves Node Rest API. Here we will use python wrapper for the API — PyWaves library, but there are other options for different programming languages, e.g. WavesCS for C#, WavesJ for Java etc.\nPywaves is an object-oriented Python interface to the Waves blockchain, which will help us to reduce code complexity while maintaining its structure, so anything you learn using this library can be applied with pure HTTP API calls.\nWhat is Waves Node REST API\nWaves Platform is a little bit complex and consists of a lot of components:\nWaves Full Node performs almost like all other decentralized-cryptocurrencies: keeps a full-copy of the blockchain, verifies the transactions. The main differences are convenient REST API and DEX(Matcher).\nNote: DEX(matcher) is disabled in default configuration file.\nNode REST API allows working with Waves Blockchain like with many other centralized platforms, e.g. Google, Facebook etc. In official Wavesplatform’s Github repository, you can find RPC API documentation and description of used data structures. If you prefer API docs in Postman interface you can follow the link\nTerms\nNode   — Full Node, it contains full-copy of the blockchain.\nMatcher (DEX)  —  part of a full node. Matcher nodes are responsible for pairing orders and executing trades quickly, whilst they are still settled on the blockchain. When a user sends an order to Matcher he doesn’t transfer ownership of his money to anyone, his money remains on his account until the order is matched with counter-order. More details can be found here and here.\nAssetPair  —  Pair of assets we want to exchange.\nTrading strategy\nScalping trading strategy widely used in trading, and crypto community is not an exception. There are a lot of variations of the strategy, the main difference between them is in size of timeframe. The strategy exploits small changes in currency prices: it buys at the mean price minus some step and sells at the mean price plus some step, in order to gain the bid/ask difference. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, in this case within 15 seconds.\nDisclaimer: I do not suggest to use scalping strategy. The strategy was chosen because of its simplicity for implementing in a bot.\nThe bot with initial parameters trades on Waves-BTC pair (Waves is an amount asset and BTC is a price_asset). The spread mean price is (best_bid + best_ask) / 2. The price step is 0.5% from the mean price. The bot places the buy order at price meanprice * (1 - price_step) and the amount (BTC_balance / bid_price) - order_fee. The sell order is placed at meanprice * (1 + price_step) and the amount equal to Waves_balance - order_fee.\nLet’s code, step-by-step\nSo, let’s get started! We’ll use Pywaves and configparser libraries for API calls and reading config file. Let's install them:\npip install pywaves\npip install configparser\n\nIt’s better to make configuration file where we will store all sensitive and customizable settings. A common way for the task in python ecosystem is .cfg format. The main section of the file will contain general settings of the bot:\n[main]\n# URI of the Full Node\nnode = http://127.0.0.1\n# select the network: testnet or mainnet\nnetwork = mainnet\n# DEX matcher\nmatcher = http://nodes.wavesnodes.com\norder_fee = 300000\n# order lifetime in seconds, max allowed 29 days\norder_lifetime = 86400\nAdditionally bot requires account and market details.\n\n[account]\nprivate_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n[market]\namount_asset = WAVES\nprice_asset = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nFirst of all, we should import all dependencies. Besides already mentioned pywaves and configparser we need next:\nimport pywaves as pw\nimport datetime from time\nimport sleep import math import os import configparser\n\nGreat, now we will define SimpleBot class as a wrapper of settings. We can set default settings in the constructor:\ndef __init__(self):\n  self.log_file = \"bot.log\"\n  self.node = \"https://nodes.wavesnodes.com\"\n  self.chain = \"mainnet\"\n  self.matcher = \"https://nodes.wavesnodes.com\"\n  self.order_fee = int(0.003 * 10 ** 8)\n  self.order_lifetime = 29 * 86400  # 29 days\n  self.private_key = \"\"\n  self.amount_asset = pw.WAVES\n  self.price_asset_id = \"8LQW8f7P5d5PZM7GtZEBgaqRPGSzS3DfPuiXrURJ4AJS\" # BTC\n  self.price_asset = pw.Asset(self.price_asset_id)\n  self.price_step = 0.005\n  self.min_amount = 1\n  self.seconds_to_sleep = 15\n\nSimpleBot also has a method for parsing configuration file and storing it in object fields, its simple enough with the configparser :\nconfig = configparser.RawConfigParser()\nconfig.read(cfg_file)\nself.node = config.get('main', 'node')\nself.chain = config.get('main', 'network')\n...\n\nUsing our new class SimpleBot and Pywaves library we finally can implement our business logic.\nPywaves requires some configuration before usage, all available methods are listed here, in our case, it’s enough to set:\npw.setNode(node=bot.node, chain=bot.chain)\npw.setMatcher(node=bot.matcher)\n\nWe also need and an instance of our address:\nmy_address = pw.Address(privateKey=bot.private_key)\n\nPywaves method AssetPair creates a new AssetPair object with 2 asset objects, which we’d like to trade:\nwaves_btc = pw.AssetPair(bot.amount_asset, bot.price_asset)\n\nIn our simple example, amount asset is WAVES, price asset is BTC, but it can be changed in the config file.\nScalping trading strategy implies infinite trading with selected timeframe size, in our case 15 sec. Let’s define an infinite loop, where we’ll :\n\nGet Waves and BTC balances.\nGet orderBook of our AssetPair. It provides python dictionary with bids and asks amounts\nCalculate mean spread price\nCalculate bid and ask\nCalculate bid and ask amounts\nPost buy and sell orders\n\nwhile True:\n  # Get waves balance\n  waves_balance = my_address.balance()\n  # Get btc balance\n  btc_balance = my_address.balance(bot.price_asset_id)\n  # Get order book\n  order_book = waves_btc.orderbook()\n  # Get best bid and ask\n  best_bid = order_book[\"bids\"][0][\"price\"]\n  best_ask = order_book[\"asks\"][0][\"price\"]\n  spread_mean_price = (best_bid + best_ask) // 2\n  bid_price = spread_mean_price * (1 - bot.price_step)\n  ask_price = spread_mean_price * (1 + bot.price_step)\n  bid_amount = int((btc_balance / bid_price) * 10 **         pw.WAVES.decimals) - bot.order_fee\n  ask_amount = int(waves_balance) - bot.order_fee\n  # Send orders\n  if bid_amount >= bot.min_amount:\n  my_address.buy(assetPair=waves_btc, amount=bid_amount,   price=bid_price, matcherFee=bot.order_fee,\n  maxLifetime=bot.order_lifetime)\n  if ask_amount >= bot.min_amount:\n  my_address.sell(assetPair=waves_btc, amount=ask_amount,   price=ask_price, matcherFee=bot.order_fee,\nmaxLifetime=bot.order_lifetime)\n  # Wait for the next tick\n  sleep(bot.seconds_to_sleep)\n\nWe’re done. Your first trading bot is ready to go!\nBest of all, the source code and documentation for this example are released to the public domain, so you can start by grabbing the code and building on top of it.\n"}}}
