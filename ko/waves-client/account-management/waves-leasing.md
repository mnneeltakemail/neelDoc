# **How to Lease your Waves**

# **Leasing or LPoS**

LPoS \(Leased Proof of Stake\) gives you the opportunity to make the network stronger and safer while receiving more Waves and other assets as a reward for doing so. It's the so called "Leasing".

Most people don't have 1000 WAVES to run their own node, so they are still able to help the whole project through leasing their Waves to someone who is able to run a node.

Most big nodes pay in a one week cycle to their users.

# **How to Lease Your Waves**

Open your Waves wallet and click on the **Leasing** button in the main menu

Click on the **Start lease** button to start leasing your Waves tokens.

This will take you to another tab.

The Leasing section has two boxes: one to specify the recipient address which would be the address of any mining pool, one to specify the amount you are willing to lease.

Fill in the fields and click on the **Start Lease** button.

Once you press the Confirm button, post entering the requisite details, the leaser would be able to see a new transaction in the **Leasing transactions table**.

So it means that you have successfully leased your Waves.

The LPoS reward depends on the conditions of the selected pool.
We do not regulate the payment process, so before using LPoS service, please read carefully the terms of payment and do your investigation of the pool that you want to use.
