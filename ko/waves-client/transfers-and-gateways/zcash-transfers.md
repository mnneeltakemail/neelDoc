# How to receive and send Zcash

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Zcash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Zcash sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Zcash token \(wZEC\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Zcash token is backed 1:1 with a real Zcash.
