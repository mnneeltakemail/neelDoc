# How to receive and send Dash

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Dash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Dash sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Dash token \(wDASH\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Dash token is backed 1:1 with a real Dash.
