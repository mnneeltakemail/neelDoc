# How to receive and send Monero

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Monero on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Monero sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Monero token \(wMonero\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Monero token is backed 1:1 with a real Monero.
