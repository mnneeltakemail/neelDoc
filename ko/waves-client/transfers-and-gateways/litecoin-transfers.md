# How to receive and send Litecoin

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Litecoin on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Litecoin sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Litecoin token \(wLTC\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Litecoin token is backed 1:1 with a real Litecoin.
