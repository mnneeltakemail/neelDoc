# How to receive and send Ethereum

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Ethereum on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Ethereum sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Ethereum token \(wETH\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Ethereum token is backed 1:1 with a real Ethereum.
