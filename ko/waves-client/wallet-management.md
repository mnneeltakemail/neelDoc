As first, it is needed to feed your wallet with some crypto. If you donâ€™t have Bitcoin \(Ether, LiteCoin or Z-Cash\), purchase them via your trusted exchange and send them to the wallet.

In order to feed your wallet, Waves-platform proposes a third-party exchange able to process your banl account, however that procedure could result much more time consuming respect your trusted supplier \(The verification process is handled by [IDnow](#) service\).

To apply for a wire transfer using your bank account you must be an identified user under the KYC/AML procedures. If you would like to apply for that, be prepared to submit your scanned ID/Passport and get prepared for a very brief webcam session. Once the procedure will be completed you will be authorized to wire bank funds _in and out _the platform.
