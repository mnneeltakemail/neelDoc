Make sure that you imported the correct account. It is enough to check Waves address by clicking on the menu button ![](/_assets/account_restoring_android_07.png)

If you find an address that does not belong to you and your balance is empty, it means that you have incorrectly restored access. To gain access, you need to repeat the restoration procedure.

**Note**: The seed phrase always contains 15 words with spaces between each word, except the beginning of the first word and the end of the last word. It is not possible to recover your password. However, you can restore your wallet only from the seed phrase, and choose a new password.

If you lose both your password and your seed, there is no way to recover your money. This is why we ask you to save your seed phrase on paper.

**Wavesplatform does not have access to users accounts and seed phrases**.
