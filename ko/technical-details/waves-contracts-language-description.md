Our realisation of smart contracts will contain two parts:

1. A **Smart Account** language implementation, It is an important property that the smart account does not store any data on the blockchain. A smart account will only have access to blockchain state values that can be retrieved and executed relatively fast, in a “constant” time. these smart accounts can be run for the price of normal transactions with a predefined fee, **without any additional “gas” or other costs**.
2. A **Foundational Layer** for developing various decentralised applications and smart contracts on the blockchain, with a built-in Turing-complete programming language.

We see the syntax of our language as functional, similar to F\#: strong and statically typed.

**Note.** [**Here**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/docs/white_paper_waves_smart_contracts.pdf) you can find our White Paper which describes Waves Smart Contract.
