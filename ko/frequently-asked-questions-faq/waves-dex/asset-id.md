# How can I find asset on the DEX using Asset ID

Important to know here is that names are not unique to prevent name squatting but the identifier, also called asset ID, is unique. Whenever you are looking for a token, search and confirm it is the right one by checking the asset ID.

Search by ticker symbol is available only for assets from this list - [The list of all assets having ticker symbol](https://support.wavesplatform.com/en/knowledge-bases/2/articles/8141-the-list-of-all-assets-having-ticker-symbol)

To start trading with any assets, please use asset name or ID of the required Asset.

See details on how to use Asset ID:
